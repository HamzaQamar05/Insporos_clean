Image Color Filter with PyTorch Integration

This project showcases a pipeline for filtering images based on color using a trained PyTorch (.pth) model. The model is created using Python, and integrated into a Node.js backend via a lightweight Python API. This setup is designed to simplify and speed up future workflows that require image filtering by color.

 Features
Color-based Image Filtering: Python script to train and generate a .pth model that filters images by their dominant colors.

Model Integration: A minimal Python API exposes the trained model for inference.

Node.js Backend: A sample Node.js backend demonstrates integration with the Python API.
